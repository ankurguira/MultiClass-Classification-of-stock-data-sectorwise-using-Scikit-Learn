## Machine Learning in Finance

For this project, under the guidance of Dr. Kushal Kr. Shah at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal, I wanted to apply Machine Learning algorithms on stock data to help traders increase their returns. The second and third part of the project can be used by any trader on the historical stock data of the stocks in their watch list, to choose better financial indicators and portfolio optimization. 

## Overview

Problems Attempted : 
* A classification problem : Classification of the NIFTY-50 companies sector-wise using their daily stock data. 
* Choosing the best financial indicators for a particular trading strategy to maximize returns.
* Portfolio Optimization: Optimization of the fractions of the trader's capital to be invested in each of the stocks in the trader's watchlist for maximum profit.

The very first problem was done as a starter to get an idea of structuring a complete Machine Learning project including data collection, data cleaning, making a prediction model and then
