# Machine Learning in Finance

For this project, under the guidance of Dr. Kushal Kr. Shah at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal, I wanted to apply Machine Learning algorithms on stock data to help traders increase their returns. The second and third part of the project can be used by any trader on the historical stock data of the stocks in their watch list, to choose better financial indicators and for portfolio optimization. 

## Overview

Problems Attempted : 
* **MultiClass Classification** : This file shows a multiclass classification of NIFTY 50 companies sector-wise using daily stock data which can be used by a beginner in Machine Learning as a starter to get an idea of structuring a complete Machine Learning project including data collection (unlike competitions), data cleaning and making a prediction model on it.
* **Best Feature Selection** : Shows how to choose the best financial indicators for a particular trading strategy to maximize returns. A trader can add more parameterss or features or financial indicators to their model and select the best out of them.
* **Portfolio Optimization** : File showing how to optimize the fractions of the trader's capital to be invested in each of the stocks in the trader's watchlist, for maximum profit.

## Downloading Data

The data used here, is of the companies on the NIFTY 50 index, National Stock Exchange of India's benchmark broad based stock market index for the Indian equity market, which has been dowloaded usng the [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com) API. 

## Requirements and Installation

In order to run these scripts, you'll need the following libraries.
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) version 1.0 or later
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html)
* [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
* [Quandle](https://www.quandl.com/tools/python0
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
